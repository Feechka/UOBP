Changes:
   DOS option syntax (/option[:value]) can only be used on DOS or Windows.
   The clipboard functions have been renamed to accurately reflect what they do:
      CUTBEGIN  -> CLIP_NEW
      CUTAPPEND -> CLIP_ADD
      CUTLINE   -> COPY_LINE
      CUTRECT   -> COPY_RECT
      COPYCHARS -> CLIP_COPY
      APNDCHARS -> CLIP_APPEND

Fixes:
   Brltty keyboard key bindings no longer interfere with Orca key bindings.
   The updating of status lines no longer confuses the cursor routing algorithm.
   The same USB device can no longer be used by more than one brltty at a time.
New Features:

      For example, help for the current keyboard key table is viewable.

   The preferences menu has been divided into a set of category-based submenus.

      Close a submenu either by scrolling to its Close item and activating it
      or via the new MENU_PREV_LEVEL function.
   The -l [--log-level=] option of brltty accepts log category names.
      The names are: ingio, inpkts, outpkts, brlkeys, kbdkeys, csrtrk, csrrtg.
      Specify the log level and/or category names as a comma-delimited list.
   The -C [--cancel-execution] option has been added to brltty.
      The same pid file must be specified by both the cancelling and the
      already-running brltty.
